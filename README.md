## Future edits:
* Edit/add/remove the questions in `checklist-questions.json`
* When changing hosting/domain, change full URL to `checklist-questions.json` in `script.js` - line 5 (realative URL cannot be used)

## Features:
* Automatic light/dark mode switch based on browser settings
* Automatic scroll to last question
* Browser "remembers" checked checkboxes, so you don't have to check again the first checkboxes when the market conditions didn't change
* If you want to go back and start again (i.e. market changes) simply uncheck checkbox from where you wish to "restart"
